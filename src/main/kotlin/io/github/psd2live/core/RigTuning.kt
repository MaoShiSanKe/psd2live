/**
 * How far the generated rig moves each part at the parameters' full values, before the head turn and body
 * strengths scale them: the head's turn on the face surface, the head shell, the face contour and the
 * feature displacement, each feature's redraw ([NinePoseFaceRig]), the gaze, blink, iris and brow keys,
 * the mouth, the hair, the face following the lean, and how far [BodyStance] turns, opens, leans and resizes
 * the body, with the Body Z lean and the breath ([RigBuilder.bodySecondaryWarpPoint]).
 *
 * Every value is in the unit the model presets show it in - degrees, percent or a multiple of the torso's
 * length - so the panel, the MCP `settings` tool and the project file all read the same numbers. A percent
 * is of the part the value's description names: the face's radius, a feature's own size, the head, the
 * torso. [fields] lists them in the panel's order with their groups, ranges and whether the panel folds
 * them under Advanced.
